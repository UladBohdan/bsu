The app uses Triangle (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) to build a Delaunay triangulation.
You may still run it without Triangle installed on your system and run algorithms on full graph.

On ubuntu Triangle may be installed as: `sudo apt-get install triangle-bin`

Triangle than should be in your $PATH
